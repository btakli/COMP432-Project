# COMP432-Project
 ML Project for COMP 432 Machine Learning, Winter 2023

 The Jupyter Notebook file is the main file of the project. It will optionally download this GitHub Repo if you run the first cell and will be able to use the functions in functions.py if so. If you wish to run directly from this GitHub repository, you can simply not run that cell.
